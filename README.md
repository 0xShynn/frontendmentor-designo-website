## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Cloud platform for serverless deployment
- [GraphCMS](http://graphcms.com) - Headless CMS
- [React Hook Form](http://react-hook-form.com) - Forms
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) - Maps
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) - For styles
- [Sizzy](https://sizzy.co/) - For the responsive web design

### What I learned

My main goal was to use this project as an opportunity to keep building projects with the jamstack approach. I used the combo Next.js, GraphCMS and Chakra UI. I'm more confident using those tools as I've learned many things (through practice, trials and documentation).

### Continued development

Next topics that I'll dig into (and integrate) : TypeScript and React animation.

### Useful resources

- [Using Mapbox with Next.js (Instead of Google Maps)](https://leerob.io/blog/using-mapbox-with-next-js) - This helped me implementing the office locations maps (I used mapbox instead of Leaflet)
